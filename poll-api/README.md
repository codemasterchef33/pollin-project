# pollin-project-express

I'm writing to provide instructions on how to run the project that I've developed using Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize ORM.

--Database Configuration:

Open the database.js file located in the project directory.
Update the database name, username, and password variables with the appropriate values for your environment.

--Starting the Server:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory using the cd command.
run command npm i
Run the command node app.js to start the server.

--Accessing the Project:

Once the server is running, you can access the project by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (assuming the server is running on port 3000).
